# .zplugins - antidote plugins file
#

### Overview
#
# The `.zplugins` file is used by antidote to configure Zsh bundles. Bundles are
# just a fancy way of referring to Zsh utilities, frameworks, prompts, or plugins.
# `.zplugins` is used by antidote to generate a static `.zplugins.zsh` file,
# which can then be sourced in your `.zshrc`. You can use this file as a starting point
# for your own config. Strip out instructional comments (ie: lines beginning with a '#')
# and any plugins you don't need, then add what you like and make it yours!
#
# NOTE: Order matters in this file! Some bundles need to be last, and others are
# prerequisites. Read the documentation for the plugins you use to ensure proper
# configuration.
#
###

### Regular Plugins
#
# Plugins are the simplest kind of bundles. You can point to a full git URL, or if you
# assume GitHub.com, then you can use the user/repo shorthand.

### Local Plugins
#
# Plugins don't have to come from GitHub. You can also use local files or directories to
# host your own custom plugins.
#
###

$ZDOTDIR/custom/editor.zsh
$ZDOTDIR/custom/aliases.zsh
$ZDOTDIR/custom/keybindings.zsh

$ZDOTDIR/plugins/config/cd-ls.zsh
$ZDOTDIR/plugins/config/wd.zsh
$ZDOTDIR/plugins/config/zsh-abbr.zsh
$ZDOTDIR/plugins/config/fzf.zsh

### Local Plugins with Variables
#
# If you want to use variables in this file, you will need to use the envsubst utility.
# It may come installed on your system, or be available in your OS package manager. Or,
# you can use the Python one-liner wrapper function included in this sample project.
# To replace environment variables, you need to change your `antidote bundle` call to
# this.
#
#   zsh_plugins=${ZDOTDIR:-~}/.zsh_plugins.zsh
#   envsubst <${zsh_plugins:r}.txt | antidote bundle >|$zsh_plugins
#
###

### Prompts
#
# You can make certain themes available to the built-in Zsh prompt command using the
# `kind:fpath` annotation. A theme is not active for the prompt until this command is
# run:
#
#   autoload -Uz promptinit && promptinit
#   prompt ${prompt_name:-pure}
#
# There are two ways to load prompts.
# - Add multiple prompt plugins to your `$fpath` with `kind:fpath` and then later in
#   your .zshrc run the Zsh built-in `prompt` to select the theme.
# - Or, just load one prompt like a regular plugin.
#

### Utilities
#
# Utilities aren't traditional Zsh plugins - they aren't sourced Zsh scripts. Instead
# they provide commands that can be executed from your terminal session. One good
# example is zsh-bench, which is a utility that benchmarks your Zsh config. Utility
# bundles can often be made available simply with the `kind:path` annotation.
#
###

### Frameworks
#
# Frameworks are a collection of Zsh features, settings, and plugins meant to ease
# Zsh configuration. Unfortunately, all that power can come with serious drawbacks.
# Frameworks can often set more settings or aliases than you need, cluttering your Zsh
# config and slowing things down. Use with caution!
#
# Frameworks are handled in antidote using the `path:location/of/plugin` annotation.
#
###

### Deferred Plugins
#
# Antidote allows you to defer loading plugins. This is similar to concepts like "turbo
# mode" in other plugin managers. Antidote handles deferring plugins by leveraging
# romkatv/zsh-defer, which "defers execution of a zsh command until zsh has nothing else
# to do and is waiting for user input". In general, you should not defer plugins unless
# you know for sure they properly support deferred loading, and there are no adverse
# side-effects (see: https://github.com/romkatv/zsh-defer#Caveats). However, for
# certain plugins, this can greatly increase your zsh startup speed.

### Completions
#
# You may want to add some additional completions to Zsh. Completions look in your fpath
# for completion functions, which are functions named with a leading underscore
# (eg: _git). You need to add all supplemental completions to your fpath prior to
# running `compinit` to use completions functionality properly. You will want to find
# a completion plugin that runs `compinit` for you, or you can run it yourself in
# your .zshrc after antidote loads like this:
#
#   autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
#
###

# zsh-users/zsh-completions is a popular plugin for adding supplemental completions.
# We combine the `path:` and `kind:fpath` annotations here:
zsh-users/zsh-completions path:src kind:fpath

# Compinit plugins should be near the end of .zplugins so that $fpath has been
# fully populated. Use zsh-utils for its completion plugin.
belak/zsh-utils path:completion

### Final Plugins
#
# Remember plugin order matters! Put plugins that need run last at the bottom of your
# .zplugins file.
#
###

# These popular core plugins should be loaded at the end
